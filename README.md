# maithili_lipi_AI_proj
The project aimed to develop machine learning techniques for character recognition of Tirhuta Lipi, a low-resource language primarily spoken in Bihar and Nepal. A diverse dataset of Tirhuta vowels was collected and preprocessed for training machine learning models. Different algorithms such as Sklearn and Tensorflow Keras were tested for character recognition, and their performance was evaluated. Overall, the project focused on developing techniques to improve language processing tasks for Tirhuta Lipi.

This project contributes to the growing field of natural language processing for low-resource languages and highlights the potential of machine learning in language-related tasks.
